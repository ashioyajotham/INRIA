Do linear models overfit?
  * Linear models are simpler than other hence they tend to overfit less
  * They even often underfit when:
     i) n_features is small eg less than 10
    ii) the problem is not linearly separable
    
However they can also overfit
   i) n_samples << n_features
  ii) Many uninformative features
  
You can introduce regualization to reduce overfitting

C=1 by default
