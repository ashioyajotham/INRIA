Categorical variables representation
   * A finite number of values called categories
   * Numerical or non-numerical variables
   
Ordinal variables representation
   * integers or string variables
   * categorical variables with a meaningful order

One Hot Encoding:
   * will create one additional column for each possible category
   * will transform string variable onto numerical representation
   
   
Underfitting:
   * Model is too constained and thus limited by expressivity
   * Model makes prediction errors even on training samples
   * train error is high but test error is low
   
Overfitting:
   * Model is too complex and thus flexible
   * Model focuses on too much on noisy details of the training set
   * train error is low but test error is high
   
* Overfitting is caused by the limited size of the training set, the noise in the data, and the high flexibility of common machine learning models.
* Underfitting happens when the learnt prediction functions suffer from systematic errors. This can be caused by a choice of model family and parameters, 
  which leads to a lack of flexibility to capture the repeatable structure of the true data generating process.
   
Assuming that we have a dataset with little noise, a model is underfitting when:
* both the train and test errors are high

For a fixed training set, by sequentially adding parameters to give more flexibility to the model, we are more likely to observe:
* a wider difference between train and test errors 
* a decrease in the train error

For a fixed choice of model parameters, if we increase the number of labeled observations in the training set, are we more likely to observe:
* a reduction in the difference between train and test errors
* an increased or steady train error

Polynomial models with a high degree parameter:
* get lower training error than lower degree polynomial models 
* are more likely to overfit than lower degree polynomial models 


Fitting a high variance model:
* causes an overfitted model
* increases the sensitivity of the learned prediction function to a random resampling of the training set observations


Fitting a model with a high bias:
* causes an underfitted model
* causes the learned prediction function to make systematic errors
