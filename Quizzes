Categorical variables representation
   * A finite number of values called categories
   * Numerical or non-numerical variables
   
Ordinal variables representation
   * integers or string variables
   * categorical variables with a meaningful order

One Hot Encoding:
   * will create one additional column for each possible category
   * will transform string variable onto numerical representation
   
   
Underfitting:
   * Model is too constained and thus limited by expressivity
   * Model makes prediction errors even on training samples
   
Overfitting:
   * Model is too complex and thus flexible
   * Model focuses on too much on noisy details of the training set
